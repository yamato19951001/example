### Getting started

#### Installation

Install Sancho using Yarn or NPM. Sancho works well with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/).

```
yarn add sancho
```

Import Sancho components into your project.

```.jsx
import { Button } from "sancho"

function Project() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Hello world!</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Styling and Emotion

Sancho uses CSS-in-JS and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for styling, and itâ€™s recommended (though not required) to use Sancho within projects that use Emotion. Emotion allows us to style components using the `css` prop - a bit like styling elements using the `style` prop, but with the benefits of pseudo selectors and the full power of css. Emotion also provides powerful and predictable composition. This means that you can pass css attributes into our components to override their styles.

```.jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "@emotion/core"
import { Button } from 'sancho'

function MyCustomButton() {
  return (
    <Button css={{ background: '#08e' }}>
      I have a blue background!
    </Button>
  )
}
```

Most Sancho components provide BEM-style class names. This allows you to configure the styles of elements contained within components.

```.jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "@emotion/core"
import { Alert, theme } from 'sancho'

function MyCustomAlert() {
  return (
    <Alert
      title='Hello world!'
      css={{
        maxWidth: '100vw',
        '& .Alert__bar': {
          display: 'none'
        },
        '& .Alert__content': {
          padding: theme.spaces.sm
        }
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

For a full explanation of why Emotion was chosen, read this [blog post](https://benmcmahen.com/why-i-choose-emotion/). You can learn more about using the `css` prop on the [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop) website.

#### Theme

Sancho uses a main `theme` object which contains global theming variables related to typography, color, spacing, and breakpoints. View the [default theme here](https://github.com/bmcmahen/sancho/blob/master/src/Theme/index.ts).

```.jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "@emotion/core"
import { theme } from 'sancho'

function Component() {
  return (
    <div css={{
      padding: theme.spaces.sm,
      color: theme.colors.text.muted,
      [theme.breakpoints.md]: {
        padding: theme.spaces.md
      }
    }}>
      Hello world
    </div>
  )
}
```

There is currently no way to override theme variables other than forking the repo. This will change soon as we migrate to using Emotion's theme provider.

### Prior art

Sancho originally started as a fork of [Evergreen](https://evergreen.segment.com/) but has since evolved to incorporate my favourite ideas from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/). We make substantial use of [Reach-UI](https://github.com/reach/reach-ui) where possible to ensure proper accessibility. This project is obviously hugely indebted to all of these projects.
