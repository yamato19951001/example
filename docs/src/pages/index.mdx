# Sancho UI

Sancho is a design system built with React, Typescript and Emotion. It's designed to be responsive, accessible, and beautiful.

<Button
component="a"
href="http://github.com/bmcmahen/sancho"
> View on Github

</Button>

<Divider style={{ margin: "1.5rem 0" }} />

## Getting started

#### Installation

Install Sancho into your react application using either Yarn or NPM.

```
yarn add sancho
```

And then import whatever components you'd like into your project.

```.jsx
import { Button } from "sancho"

function Project() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Hello world!</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Styling and Themes

Sancho uses [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for styling. The reasons for choosing Emotion are outlined in this [blog post](https://benmcmahen.com/why-i-choose-emotion/). You can override component styles by passing in custom css using the `css` prop. Learn more about using the `css` prop on the [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop) website.

```.jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "@emotion/core"
import { Button } from 'sancho'

function MyCustomButton() {
  return (
    <Button css={{ background: '#08e' }}>
      I have a blue background!
    </Button>
  )
}
```

Sancho uses a main `theme` object which contains global theming variables related to type, colours, spacing, and breakpoints. View the [default theme here](https://github.com/bmcmahen/sancho/blob/master/src/Theme/index.ts).

```.jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "@emotion/core"
import { theme } from 'sancho'

function Component() {
  return (
    <div css={{
      padding: theme.spaces.sm,
      color: theme.colors.text.muted,
      [theme.breakpoints.md]: {
        padding: theme.spaces.md
      }
    }}>
      Hello world
    </div>
  )
}
```

There is currently no way to override theme variables other than forking the repo. This will change soon as we migrate to using Emotion's theme provider.

### Prior art

Sancho originally started as a fork of [Evergreen](https://evergreen.segment.com/) and eventually incorporated some of my favourite ideas from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/). This project is obviously hugely indebted to those.
