# Sancho

Sancho is a design system built with React, Typescript and Emotion. It's designed to be responsive, accessible, and beautiful. It takes its inspiration from [Evergreen](https://evergreen.segment.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), and [Reach-UI](https://github.com/reach/reach-ui) for accessibility.

[View the docs](/coming-soon) for full usage details.
